# Quickstarts

These are the Jomres Quickstarts with ALL the 170+ Core Plugins including open source Plugin Manager so your website will never expire. All open source.

Just download all the files from a folder above, then double click on the EXE file. It will self extract a ZIP file with everything in it. Just upload the ZIP file to your server/account and extract it. Read the "Read Me 1st" file for install help.

Jomres is big, and it's powerful. It's extremely flexible and offers a huge variety of ways you can configure it, but unless you're familiar with it, it takes time to learn how to set it up.

These Quickstarts are designed to get you up and running with a complete Jomres site in just minutes. Each file corresponds to one of the following Demo installations (in fact the Quickstarts are used to create those demos).

# *** UPDATE ***
Jomres is now ALL Open Source. Even the Jomres Plugin Manager is now Open Source. Never need a Jomres licence to run your website. It will never expire. The ONLY time you would need to get a Jomres Licence is to update the plugins. And for that you will only need a one month license. Or you can download the updated plugin here from free.
